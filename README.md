Created using Spring Initializr and eclipse for Spring Boot web and Maven. 

So, basic framework web configuration was generated by default.

Create 2 REST services: one that allows to register a user and the other one that displays the details of an registered user. You don’t need to spend too much time on this exercise – few hours, the goal is to be able to quickly check your code !

Requirements:
- define a user (what are the fields needed). We should have mandatory and optional fields!
- validate the input and return proper error messages/http status
- log the input and output of each call and the processing time.
- have a request parameter which is not mandatory and which provides a default value in case is not set
- have a path variable
- clear code and javadoc
- unit tests
- only adults ( age > 18 years)  and that live in France can create an account!
