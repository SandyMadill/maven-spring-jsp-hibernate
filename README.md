Created using Spring Initializr and eclipse for Spring Boot web and Maven. 

So, basic framework web configuration was generated by default.

Create 2 REST services: one that allows to register a user and the other one that displays the details of an registered user. You don�t need to spend too much time on this exercise � few hours, the goal is to be able to quickly check your code !

## User documentation
- define a user (what are the fields needed). We should have mandatory and optional fields!
- validate the input and return proper error messages/http status
- log the input and output of each call and the processing time.
- have a request parameter which is not mandatory and which provides a default value in case is not set
- have a path variable
- clear code and javadoc
- unit tests
- only adults ( age > 18 years)� and that live in France can create an account!


There are two fronts one in Jsp and the other in React. Bootstrap is inscluded in this project.

## start spring web server
mvn spring-boot:run

## on the web browser in Jsp 
http://localhost:8080/demo/user

## react.js redux front end server
yarn start (to start the front in react)
http://localhost:3000
I created a React front end using this documentation
